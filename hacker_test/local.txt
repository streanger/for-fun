The Hacker Test - Version 1.0
This test was conceived and written by Felix Lee, John Hayes and Angela Thomas at the end of the spring semester, 1989. It has gone through many revisions prior to this initial release, and will undoubtedly go through many more.
(Herewith a compendium of fact and folklore about computer hackerdom, cunningly disguised as a test.)

Scoring - Count 1 for each item that you have done, or each question that you can answer correctly.

If you score is between -> You are

0x000 and 0x010 -> Computer Illiterate
0x011 and 0x040 -> a User
0x041 and 0x080 -> an Operator
0x081 and 0x0C0 -> a Nerd
0x0C1 and 0x100 -> a Hacker
0x101 and 0x180 -> a Guru
0x181 and 0x200 -> a Wizard
Note: If you don't understand the scoring, stop here.
